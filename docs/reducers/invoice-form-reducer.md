# Invoice Form Reducer

Defines an initial state and a reducer function to handle state updates for an invoice form. The initial state includes fields for the date created, date due, bill from email, name and phone number, bill to email, name and phone number, bank name, account name, bank account, and an item container with content, quantity, and price. The reducer function includes cases for updating the form data, adding item container data, submitting form data to Firebase, fetching data from Firebase, deleting an invoice, resetting the invoice form, and handling errors. The UPDATE_INVOICE_FORM_DATA case updates the form data for a given field name and value, while the ADD_ITEM_CONTAINER_DATA case adds a new item container to the form. The SUBMIT_INVOICE_FORM_DATA case logs the form data and pushes it to an array of all invoice data. The FETCH_FIREBASE_INVOICE_DATA case updates the state with invoice data from Firebase, while the DELETE_INVOICE case filters out a deleted invoice from the all invoice data array. The RESET_INVOICE_FORM case resets the form to its initial state.
